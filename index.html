                        In financial markets, trading (in Spanish, negotiation, commerce) is the commercialization of financial instruments with the aim of obtaining a profit. Trading is mainly based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis and the application of a specific trading strategy.

People who practice the trading profession are known as traders (or, alternatively, self-employed traders or traders), who can work independently, in an investment fund, in a bank or in another financial institution. Traders are classified as scalpers, day traders, swing traders 3 and position traders depending on the duration of their operations. The opposite of a trader is an investor, who operates long-term by nature. A trader can act as an intermediary agent, speculator, arbitrageur or hedge operator, with the aim of obtaining a profit. In addition to being individual traders and managing their own capital, they can manage capital from third parties as money managers.</p>

                    <strong><p>The origins of trading:</p></strong>

                        <li>
                            They can be traced back to ancient civilizations that exchanged goods and services. This rudimentary trading system eventually evolved into more complex operations with the invention of currency and the rise of markets.</li>

                            In Japan, during the 16th century, the rice trade was the first scenario in which a type of formalized trading was carried out. Munehisa Homma, a rice trader, developed what we now know as candlestick and futures contract analysis, becoming a pioneer in this field.</li>
                        <li>
                            In the mid-17th century in Europe, the first private equity companies began to form, a phenomenon that had its origins in the practice of selling future profits from trading voyages.</li>
                            <li>
                                This stock exchange model spread over time to other regions, forming markets in London, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. These markets provide investors with a platform to trade a wide range of assets, including stocks, currencies and futures.

                                In the 21st century, trading has evolved significantly, especially when it comes to technology. The emergence of online trading platforms has democratized the activity, eliminating the need for a physical broker and allowing anyone with a computer and an internet connection to participate in financial markets. In turn, these platforms have diversified the scope of trading, including varieties such as 'Day Trading', 'Scalping', 'Swing Trading' and 'Trend or Directional Trading'. *Analysis made based on a compilation of articles from BBVA, DailyForex, among others

                        A trader usually has a background in exact or social sciences (Economics, Administration, Accounting, Psychology, Engineering) with knowledge not only in finance, but also in mathematics and statistics.5</p>
                    <p>
                        In banks and funds, remunerations are usually high compared to other professions, due to the "bonuses" they receive at the end of the year according to what they have earned for the entity. The bonus can be several times the fixed salary. The career is usually quite short (few people are over 40 years old), but with the crisis of 2008-2012, this fact has a tendency to change. One of the justifications for high salaries and bonuses is the stress generated by the market, and the responsibility due to the amount of money that is sometimes being managed by a single person (investments of tens of millions).</p>

                       A trader operates in the markets in the short term and aspires to have quick profitability, but the search for money through short-term activities in the financial markets is contrary to some religious morals, but supported by other religions. Although it is worth clarifying that there are also operations that can last even months.</p>
                       <p>
                           An independent trader can also have very good results, but very few have this consistency. Therefore 5 out of 100 are profitable in the long term. Keep in mind that each trader is unique, and that the best stock market course for you will always be the one that best suits your personality and lifestyle.</p>
                           <p>
                               A profession related to that of the trader is that of the broker or stockbroker, although the latter is limited to intermediating between buyers and sellers, receiving a commission for each operation, while the trader buys and sells assets for himself seeking a profit. in the difference between the purchase price and the subsequent sale price or vice versa</p>

                       A trader uses one or more combinations of strategies, basing his decisions on various analyses. These might be:</p>
                    <code>Technical analysis</code>
                    <code>Fundamental analysis</code>
                    <code>Macroeconomic analysis</code>
                    <code>Quantitative analysis</code>
                    <code>Reopening of positions</code>
                    <p>
                        Effective trading is the sum of all these strategies and compression of market fractality
